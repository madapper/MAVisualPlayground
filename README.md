MAVisualPlayground
==================

An assortment of visual effects just for the sake of it.This little playground includes 4 efects that I just enjoyed making:

<b>Random Colours</b>

This is a simple random effect using NSTimer to change the shape colour and radius of the different views on the screen. If you drag your finger the views will move towards your finger tehn mov back to their original position

<b>Flying frames</b>

Really simple Frames expanding towards a center point with text. I just enjoyed the feling of the movement

<b>Sparks</b>

Basic particle sparks. Needs a bit of work and fine tuning.

<b>Colour Scroller<b/>

More of a memory test than anyting else!

Have fun and enjoy the project.This is really not meant for anything more than just being nice!
